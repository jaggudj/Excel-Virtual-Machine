## Purpose

This project aims to accurately compile common programming languages and features into Microsoft Excel (2015) files.

## How to Use

This project is currently incomplete.
From the latest release version: output a compiled file by using the command `Excel_VM myFile.file -outputExcelFile` (or `Excel_VM myFile.file` for a g++ compatible assembly file).
The compiled Excel file can be executed by triggering iterative calculation (pressing F9 repeatedly) in Microsoft Excel.
By default, 500 iterations are made each time. To ensure accuracy, do not disturb the spreadsheet before it is finished recalculating.

## Motivation

This was created for my (the creator's) personal interest, and as a learning experience in compiler design.

## Purpose

This project aims to accurately compile common programming features into Microsoft Excel (2015) files.

## Motivation

This was created for my (the creator's) personal interest, and as a learning experience in compiler design.

## How to Use

The project is currently incomplete - once completed, it will output a compiled file when executed which can be executed by triggering iterative calculation (pressing F9 repeatedly) in Microsoft Excel.
